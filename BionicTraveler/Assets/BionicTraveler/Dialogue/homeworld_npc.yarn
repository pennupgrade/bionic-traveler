This is the homeworld of our protagonist; 
In the beginning, Dess attends try-outs for the imperial legion, but fails the test.
We venture out of here into the unknown wilderness of the newly discovered planet seeking a cure for the disease of our best friend. 
The government seems supportive, but are their intentions pure?

Greensfeld is the majority of the grassy plains that cover this planet.
To the WEST is Valenfeld.
To the NORTH is the Misty Mountains.
To the NORTHEAST is Connecticut. I can never seem to pronounce it correctly.
I used to go hunting in the mountains, but these days I can never go anymore.

We can barely go out, let alone hunt anymore since the animals became corrupted by the scourge.
Not to mention, the village chief's son hasn't come back home in weeks. 
I hope he's ok and hasnâ€™t met his fate at the hands of the scourge.
The Village Chief is planning to visit the Sage. If there's anyone who can save us, it's the sage!
